## Practice OOP using JavaScript

### Project 1

- Build front end for a simple shopping cart web application.

### Project 2

- Use Vanilla JavaScript to communicate between DOM components (practice oop and callback functions).

- Play around with events and event listeners.

- Use Modules to improve the code (need to use a dummy web server; can google "server js" and install Node.js and then use npm to install the [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve))
